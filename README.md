## Special application on neonates
A custom YOLO network is used to crop the baby as a preprocessing step.
This network was created based on this repo: [https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-YOLOv3][PyTorch-YOLOv3]

Our modified version:

## NVIDIA Jetson Nano inference
The running speed of the networks are tested on NVIDIA Jetson Nano. Results and the installation steps of `PyTorch` and `OpenCV` are in the `nano` folder.
